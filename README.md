What if you write here before the image embedding, what will it do? I am very curious about where the writing will be and where the image will end up. I need to write long enough so that the image has a chance to wrap around and stuff. I am rather an experimental coder than a careful one. I need to be more careful I guess haha <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iggyim/egunim/main/images/HeadShot_mod.jpg">
